# Open-Recipe: An Open Source Food Recipe File Format and API

Welcome to **Open-Recipe**, an open-source project for creating a standardized food recipe file format and associated APIs.

This project includes a reference implementation that allows users to create and view recipes in a web browser, and fetch
recipes via a REST API.

The [Open-Recipe OpenAPI document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbutland/open-recipe/refs/heads/main/open-recipe.yaml) can be viewed using the [online swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbutland/open-recipe/refs/heads/main/open-recipe.yaml).

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation can be run locally and accessed in a web browser at http://localhost:3000 once running.
Full instructions on how to do this can be found in the projects [README.md](https://github.com/pbutland/open-recipe/blob/main/README.md) file.
